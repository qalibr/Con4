# Project

This is a connect four game web app using React (Vite) and Capacitor for porting to native platforms.

## TL;DR

Command line commands for development:

### Web development with live reload.

``npm run dev``

``npm run test``

### Port to Android

_Requires setup, see below_

``npm run build``

``npx cap copy``

``npx cap sync``

``npx cap run android``

### We can run the test suite with Docker.

``docker-compose up``

## Tools

- NodeJS
    - Due to an annoying
      error (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68774489/punycode-is-deprecated-in-npm-what-should-i-replace-it-with)
      We are using Node LTS 20.11 for this project.
        - Uninstall NodeJS before installing nvm.

- Java v17
    - JDK for native development.
- Gradle v8.5.0
    - Build system for native development.
- Docker
    - ~~Web development and testing in a sanitized environment.~~ Vite broke it, worked well with CRA.
    - Local testing.
- React
    - Template made using Vite
    - For easy frontend development.
    - Using typescript template.
- shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI and Heroicons
    - Developing the User Interface using shadcn/ui
        - An extremely easy to use and beautiful component library.
        - Used for light/dark mode theme switch, used for buttons and menus.
    - ~~Also using Headless UI and Heroicons which are libraries made by the Tailwind CSS team to complement the main
      library.~~
    - ~~Tailwind for styling, headless for component logic, and heroicons for graphical elements.~~
- Capacitor
    - Porting web app to native platforms.
- Supabase
    - BaaS (backend-as-service) for authentication and database.

# Development Commands

You will be running the app from the command line.

## Web dev:

Run ``npm run dev``

### ~~Development through Docker~~ **(Don't use)**

**This does not work reliably with Vite, as opposed to CRA.**

The web development portion has working hot loading.

1. ``docker-compose up`` to start
2. ``docker-compose down -v`` to end.
    - Don't forget the -v flag. It's necessary to clean up volumes in Docker Hub.

## Open App on Android

1. ``npm run build`` Build React project
2. ``npx cap copy``
3. ``npx cap sync`` Superset of copy, just use both anyway.
4. ``npx cap run android`` Choose emulator from the list.

You can open the emulator from Android Studio first and have it ready in the list. It will have a different
name than the ones you have in your Virtual Device Manager. Example:

``Please choose a target device: Â» Google sdk_gphone64_x86_64 (emulator-5554)``

## Testing

Run ``npm run test`` to run your test suite and exit.

Run ``npm run coverage`` to run your tests and then wait for file changes. Upon file change test suite automatically
re-runs.

### Docker Testing

We can also use Docker to run tests ``docker-compose up``

# Set up environment

In order to use emulators from your Android Studio some setup is required.

## Install Java

Download and install JDK 17

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html

Then add:

``
Variable name: JAVA_HOME
``

``
Variable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17
``

To your environment variables. Confirm they work with:

``
java --version
``

``
javac --version
``

Should return v17 for both, if not make sure a newer version isn't overwriting v17. Go to _add or remove programs_ and
delete the newer version and try again to see if the correct version is used.

## Install Android

Open Android Studio, press the dropdown _More Actions_ and choose SDK Manager, then go to tab SDK Tools and install
at least 33.0.2.

Android SDK should be in your environment variables like this:

``
Variable name: ANDROID_HOME
``

``
Variable value: C:\Users\jorge\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
``

## Install Gradle

Download version 8.5 (Binary only)

https://gradle.org/releases/

Unzip the folder somewhere, then go into environment variables and add this:

``"...\gradle-8.5\bin"``

to _system variables_ and *Path*. This is not the same as what you did with Java and Android.
